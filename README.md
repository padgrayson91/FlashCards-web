# FlashCards-web
Web version of the FlashCards app, to eventually serve as the backend for the Android app as well

## Roadmap
Eventually, this web app should feature the following
  * Nice UI (currently leaves a lot to be desired!)
  * Ability to import decks of cards from the Android app
  * Leaderboards for each deck
